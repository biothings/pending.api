"ingest_description": >-
  JensenLab DISEASES contains associations from their text-mining pipeline and from
  human-curated resources that are hard to access or parse (MedlinePlus, AmyCo).
  We retrieve this association data from the 'text mining channel' and 'knowledge
  channel' files. We chose to use the 'filtered' versions of these files because we
  wanted the non-redundant data without subclass reasoning. We removed duplicated
  lines (associations), lines that didn't have an ENSP ID in the gene_id column or a
  DOID in the disease_id column (wouldn't be able to run NodeNorm on them), and lines
  from the "UniProtKB-KW" resource (we didn't find DISEASES's ingest of this resource
  high-quality).
