# General and ingest-specific info about the ingest source(s)
## removed fields because I didn't have this info:
## - "source_data_version": DISEASES doesn't provide any versioning
## - "source_publication_date": DISEASES doesn't provide a publication/creation date for their download files
## - "source_data_files": seems redundant with source_access_urls in this case (we only downloaded files we used)

# Metadata about the dataset/graph produced by the ingest (consider what applies to an intermediate KGX- artifact, vs a final KGX+, normalized, Biolink-compliant artifact). 
## removed fields because I didn't have this info:
## - "target_data_version": not sure what to put here. Would have to ask ingest team
## - "target_license": I don't know what to put here - likely depends on Translator policy / Andrew and Chunlei input.
