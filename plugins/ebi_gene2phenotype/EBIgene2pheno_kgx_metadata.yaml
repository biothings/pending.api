"ingest_description": >-
  EBI's Gene2Phenotype contains high-quality gene-disease associations curated by experts. This resource
  produces a static release on their FTP site ~ every month. We download all association files (organized
  by panel) and removed duplicate rows (associations), rows that didn't have an ID in the disease_mim
  column, and rows that had a confidence column value of 'disputed' or 'refuted'. We also do not include
  many of the resource's columns in our final KGX+ output.
